# Simple CRUD Patient Management System (VB.NET & MySQL)
This repository contains the assets and codes for creating a Visual Basic Application connected to a MySQL Database - a key component for the	IT Infrastructure and Network Technologies course.

This project implements a patient management system using a combination of technologies:
* Frontend: Developed using Visual Basic.NET (VB.NET).
* Backend: Utilizes PHP for server-side scripting and interaction with the database.
* Database: Leverages MySQL for storing and managing patient data.

## Features
The system offers basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for patient records, enabling users to:
* Create new patient entries, including details like name, contact information, and medical history.
* Read existing patient data, allowing retrieval of specific patient information.
* Update patient records to reflect any changes in patient details.
* Delete patient data when necessary, ensuring proper data management.
